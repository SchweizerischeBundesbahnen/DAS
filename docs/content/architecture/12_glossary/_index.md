Terminology, abbreviations and its translations.
{{< /callout >}}

Most relevant terms are specified by the [SFERA 3](https://www.uic.org/projects-99/article/sfera-smart-communications-for-efficient-rail-activities) protocol.

Be aware, the project deals heavily with SFERA 3 object translations in german, french and italian for locomotive personnel (mainly engine drivers) and its represenation to a Tablet user-interface. 
Therefore, this page contains only a very small subset of expressions.

Remarks:
* [SBB internal Glossary](https://glossar.sbb.ch/UI7/index.xsl#Terminology)
* Unfortunately there is no public railyway glossary easy to use and extend yet.
