## Problem Background

A comprehensive logging concept is required so that DAS can act efficiently in the event of an error
or support case and to ensure continuous monitoring of the systems. This concept should ensure that
all relevant data can be recorded, stored and analysed. As a result, errors can be recognised and
rectified at an early stage and events can be fully traced.

## Influences on the Decision

* We can choose different logging services for each tenant.
* Itâ€™s easier to update backend APIs than to change the mobile client.

## Assumptions

None.

## Considered Alternatives

1. Deliver via direct API

## Decisions

Delivery via backend.
